It is a traumatic experience because they are not prepared for intercourse at all at that time," he said.<br><br>Other than psychological trauma, the girls may also experience trauma around the genitalia because their bodies are not mature for intercourse.<br><br>Ikol says the trauma may affect them later in life because they may be disinterested in intercourse when they grow up and are at high risk of developing cancer.<br><br>"When you engage in sex early in life, there is always the risk of cancer development because the cervix is not mature enough," he said.<br><br>There is also a high HIV prevalence among the Samburu youth practising beading because the morans are not limited to a single sexual partner.<br><br>They also do not necessarily practise safe sex options. A strategic plan report by the county government shows the county has a HIV prevalence rate of 5 per cent against a population of 274,079.<br><br>"This means there are an estimated 13,073 HIV victims, of which only 6,883 know their status, leaving over 6,190 victims who do not know their HIV status," the report reads.<br><br>The report further indicates a low condom uptake among men, meaning that even with multiple partners, unsafe sex is still highly practised.<br><br>Women have been reported to resort to using female condoms disbursed as beauty hand ornaments, despite low supply.<br><br>Other factors, such as limited access to reproductive health awareness and reduced empowerment also increase chances of transmission.<br><br>The health of these girls is further put at risk when they are 'cut' in preparation for marriage.<br><br>"There are different degrees of the cut that have different health implications. Those practising may develop problems with urination or develop persistent pain around the genitalia, which makes it difficult to engage in intercourse later in life.<br><br>Child birth also becomes a problem because the birth canal is narrow," he said. In cases where the girl experiences a tear around the birth canal, she is put at risk of developing recto-vaginal fistula, where stool is passed from the birth canal.<br><br>The treatment options available to these girls depend on the degree of the damage caused.<br><br>Due to the age group, after rescue, the girls are examined under anesthesia to assess the degree of the injuries incurred.<br><br>"If there are any injuries we can repair, we perform corrective surgery. We also subject them to counselling and try and find safe homes for them," he said. <br><br></p>
